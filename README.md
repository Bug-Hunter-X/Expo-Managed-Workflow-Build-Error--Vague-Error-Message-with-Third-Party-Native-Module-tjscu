# Expo Managed Workflow Build Error: Vague Error Message

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using Expo's managed workflow with a third-party native module. The error message during the Android build process is unhelpful, making debugging difficult. 

The `bug.js` file contains a simplified representation of the code that causes the problem.  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a potential solution.  Note that the exact solution may vary depending on the specific native module used.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Attempt to build the app for Android using `expo build:android`. (the exact error is very difficult to reproduce.)

## Potential Solutions

This error can be caused by several underlying issues. The solution presented in `bugSolution.js` is one potential approach. Investigate native module dependencies, version conflicts, or configuration issues to pinpoint the exact cause in your environment.
