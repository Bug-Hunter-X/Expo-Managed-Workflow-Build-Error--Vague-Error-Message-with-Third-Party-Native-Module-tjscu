While building an Expo app, I encountered an error related to the interaction between Expo's managed workflow and a third-party native module.  The error message was vague and unhelpful, mentioning something about a missing dependency or a build system conflict, but didn't point to the specific module or the root cause.  I tried cleaning the build cache, reinstalling node modules, and even creating a fresh Expo project, but the problem persisted.  The problem only occurred when building for Android.
